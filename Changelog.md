## [Unreleased] Fancier Block Particles Version 0.8 Changelog

### Highlight

#### Revamped configs! 

The new configs are easier to read understand and use, they are also faster which makes FBP have nearly no impact on loading times.

***Old Configs will be deleted so please back them up before launching if you have made major changes to them***

#### Dynamic Weather System

Now weather will follow the current weather, it will rain heavier when a thunderstorm is happening.

### Added

- Dynamic Weather System (rain & snow)
- Weather Particles Render Distance option

### Changed

- Revamped Main config file
- Revamped Floating Materials config file
- Fancy Rain and Fancy Snow config options have been replaced by Fancy Weather option
- Changed behavior of Fancy Block Placement with slabs placing slabs one on top of another should be a better experience
- Changed floating materials config format to be more user-friendly and faster (Old config will be detected and replaced by the new defaults)
- Smoke particles are now slightly more transparent
- The config button in Forge's mod options now works
- Updated `mcmod.info` to feature new description and better credits

### Fixed

- Fixed crashes with some moded blocks ([#7])
- Fixed crashes with some moded blocks when HWYLA is installed ([#13])
- Fixed Memory leak with `FBP##originalEffectRenderer` ([#139])
- Fixed Fancy Block Placement speed being broken because of an accidental change in 0.7
- Fixed new config having no default value

### Removed

- Removed Rest On Floor option ([#9])

### Optimization

- Vectors got a redesign as a result FBP should now be faster and use less VRAM
- Hex colors are now used instead of 4 separate R,G,B and A variables which makes rendering faster ([#10])
- As the result of a big code cleanup FBP as a whole should now be faster, load faster and use slightly less resources
- Optimized Rendering of Fancy Block Placement and all particles as a result, they should be faster and use slightly less GPU, RAM & VRAM
- FBP now uses its own math utilities and Jafama fast math library which should result in better performance
- Lossless textures compression resulting in 3.535 KB smaller mod size

### Internal

- Added documentation for Vector2D, Vector3D, and FBPRenderer
- Switched to [Anatawa] amazing [FG2.3 fork]
- Updated to Gradle 7.6
- Cleanup build.gradle & gradle.properties
- Gradle now automatically updates the version in `ModReference.java`
- Gradle now automatically increment the dev version by one each build
- Now use a forked version of [Universal Tweaks] for faster development environment loading times
- Cleanup the entire code
- Vectors redesign
- Major Refactors
- Renamed most of the variables from unreadable names to readable names
- Finished removing useless `@SideOnly`
- Removed useless `isRemote` checks
- Moved creation of particles to `ParticleUtil.java`

#### Vectors Redesign

In 0.7 and before FBP was using Minecraft `Vec2f` and `Vec3d` but they have a few problems, by example `Vec3d` lack features like `set`, `copy` or even `scale` plus some of its features are written in a complex and slow manner.
Also, they have a `ZERO` variable which is useless and takes resource's for nothing this is even worst for `Vec2f` since it has tons of useless variables.
And having control over them is really nice, so we need to make our own.

Introducing `Vector2D` and `Vector3D` the brand-new vectors for FBP, which are faster easier to work with and come with great documentation!

#### Changes in error handling

Non-critical try-catch blocks should now never throw a runtime exception or print a stack trace except when debug mode is added they should print a stack trace and count towards the issues counter and their respective counters (Rendering Issues, Physics Issues, Performance Issues, etc.)
